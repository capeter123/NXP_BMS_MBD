Models:
======
sim_pil_test.mdl - test harness model for PIL simulation
sim_acc_test.mdl - test harness model for Accelerator mode simulation
sim_sil_test.mdl - test harness model for SIL simulation

sim_pil_acc_target.mdl   - referenced model for PIL and Accelerator mode simulation
sim_pil_target_block.mdl - PIL model block
sim_sil_target.mdl       - referenced model for SIL and Accelerator mode simulation
sim_sil_target_block.mdl - SIL model block

Hardware:
========
MPC5643L EVB 


Setup:
=====
Connect serial interface cable to the board.

Open RAppID_564xL_Config block parameters window of sim_pil_acc_target.mdl model and set COM port number. 

Open RAppID_564xL_Config block parameters window of sim_pil_target_block.mdl model and set COM port number. 


Description:
==========
The models test for PIL simulation for top model and for PIL block.

For top model PIL simulation open sim_pil_test.mdl model and select "Start simulation". 
For top model Accelerator mode simulation open sim_acc_test.mdl model and select "Start simulation". 
For top model SIL simulation open sim_sil_test.mdl model and select "Start simulation". 

For PIL block simulation open sim_pil_target_block.mdl model and select "Build Subsystem" for "PIL_block" block. 
After PIL block is generated open sim_pil_test.mdl block, remove "Model" block and insert generated PIL block instead. 
Then select "Start simulation". 

For SIL block simulation open sim_sil_target_block.mdl model and select "Build Subsystem" for "SIL_block" block. 
After SIL block is generated open sim_sil_test.mdl block, remove "Model" block and insert generated SIL block instead. 
Then select "Start simulation". 


Miscellaneous details:
=====================
Matlab R2009a and earlier does not support PIL and SIL block simulation.
